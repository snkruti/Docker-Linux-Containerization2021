# Containerization or virtualization

## Virtualization
* **Virtualization** allows you to run multiple operating systems on one physical server's hardware

* **Virtual machines** are perfect for supporting applications that need the full functionality of an operating system when you choose to run several applications on a server or have a wide range of operating systems to accommodate them.

*  **Virtual machine** have a longer lifecycle and are better used for longer periods of time than containers.

## Containerization

* **containerization** allows you to install multiple applications on a single virtual machine or server using the same operating system.

* **Containers** are a better choice if the main goal is to minimize the number of servers you are using for differnt applications.

* For activities with a much shorter lifecycle, **containers** are an excellent option.
They are perfect for tasks that can only take a few hours, with their quick set-up time.
