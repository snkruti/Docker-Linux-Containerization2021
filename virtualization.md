## What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the idea of creating a virtual environment, such as an operating system, on a host machine without requiring additional hardware assets. Some of the benefits of virtualization include the ability to effortlessly run different operating systems at the same time, easy recovery of progress and maintanence in case of any system failure, and the significantly lowered costs due to mulitple expensive hardware assets not being needed anymore.

Here is an example of what virtualization looks like:

The picture above shows the machine running three different guest operating systems through the host, and each app is run on a different operating system.

An overload of virtual operating systems on the host machine will cause a slowdown of performance, and much quicker performance breakdowns, which isnt good for any physical machine. This can cause unstable performance, and a much longer boot-up time.
