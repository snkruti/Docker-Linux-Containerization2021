## What is Containerization?

Containerization brings virtualization the the big picture. Its more reliable and efficient, since it does not require guest operating systems to run each application. Containers can work on cloud systems, virtual machines, and bare metal sytems that work across MacOS, Windows, and Linux.


Containerization is super efficient and much more reliable, because as shown above, there is no need to share libraries and resources, unlike virtual machines, therefore, wasting no resources. This also will boot up in a fraction of the time, within seconds, and only holds relevant information.
